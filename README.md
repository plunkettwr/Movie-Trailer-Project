# Movie Trailer Project
Adding a few lines of code to the entertainment_center.py file allows the user to generate a webpage that presents all their favorite movies. The movies poster, trailer, runtime, rating and IMDb score will all be displayed in the browser.

## Getting Started
All the necessary files can be downloaded [here](https://github.com/plunkettwr/Movie-Trailer-Project).

A free API Key from [OMDb](http://www.omdbapi.com/apikey.aspx) is required.

## Use
In line 7 of the media.py file assign your API key for OMDb to the Movie class attribute `apikey`.

In the entertainment_center.py file create movie objects and add the objects to the movies list.

_Example_
```
my_movie1 = media.Movie(
	"[URL for movie's trailer]",
	"[IMDb ID]")

my_movie2 = media.Movie(
	"[URL for movie's trailer]",
	"[IMDb ID]")

movies = [my_movie1, my_movie2]
```
IMDb ID's can be found in the url for the movie's IMDb page. In the example url below the IMDb ID is *tt2015381*.
http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2015381/?ref_=nv_sr_2

Once all the desired movies have been added to entertainment_center.py the web page will be generated by running entertainment_center.py.
